When JDK compatibility is disabled, a HazelcastInstance must acquire permits before releasing them and it cannot release a permit that it has mot acquired. It means, you can acquire a permit from one thread and release it from another thread using the same HazelcastInstance, but not different HazelcastInstances. In this mode, acquired permits are automatically released upon failure of the holder HazelcastInstance. So there is a minor behavioral difference to the Semaphore#release() method."
